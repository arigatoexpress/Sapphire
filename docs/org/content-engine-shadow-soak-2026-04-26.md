# Content-Engine Remote Shadow Soak

## Goal

Move `content-engine` from blocked to remote-shadow soak without changing the
local canonical runtime. The Mac LaunchAgent remains authoritative until the
documented soak gate passes and a later PR disables it with rollback notes.

## What Changed

- Remote workflow: `.github/workflows/content-engine.yml`
- Local routine shadowed: `com.sapphire.content-engine`
- Comparator: `scripts/ops/compare_content_artifacts.py`
- Uploaded artifact: `content-engine-<run_id>`

## Safety Posture

- The workflow runs `python -m lib.content`, which writes draft and ready files.
- It does not run `python -m lib.content --publish`.
- `SAPPHIRE_PUBLISH_LIVE=0` is set in the workflow.
- `SAPPHIRE_CONTENT_TELEGRAM_SUMMARY=0` is set in the workflow.
- Local content publishing side effects remain governed by the separate
  `com.sapphire.content-publisher` LaunchAgent and its explicit opt-ins.

## Comparator

Run after downloading a GitHub Actions artifact:

```bash
python3 scripts/ops/compare_content_artifacts.py \
  --local-root /Users/aribs/Code/Sapphire \
  --remote-root /path/to/downloaded/content-engine-artifact
```

The comparator checks:

- Matching report kinds.
- Matching platform coverage per report kind.
- Remote quality failures when the local rendering passed.
- Rendered artifact existence and size/hash drift.
- Source/tag/title drift as WARN unless strict mode is requested.

## Soak Gate

At least 7 scheduled daily cycles with:

- zero FAIL comparisons,
- no remote-only quality failures,
- matching report-kind/platform coverage,
- local LaunchAgent rollback documented before any disablement.

## Rollback

Revert the PR that adds `.github/workflows/content-engine.yml` and the
manifest stage change. The local LaunchAgent remains untouched.
